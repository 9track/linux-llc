Some LLC applications expect to be able to accept new connections and 
transfer data on the same SAP. With LLC sockets this is not very easily done.

Here is my understanding of what you would like to do:

local:                          remote:
00:00:00:00:00:00@0x50    -->   01:02:03:04:05:06@0x50
12:12:12:12:12:12@0x50   <--    24:24:24:24:24:24@0x50

Now what this means is that you need to have the same socket (SAP) in a
LISTEN state and a CONNECTED state on each machine. With sockets this is
not possible, as no data can be transfered over a socket in the LISTEN
state. 

It is my understanding that this is how TCP works too. I don't think it is
all that bad to make the user application open a listen SAP and another
SAP for data transfer as a benefit of the socket API for LLC.

Please let me know what you think and if I am not seeing some part of this
problem. Also if you are aware of a protocol that uses llc which will
*not* work because of this let me know.
