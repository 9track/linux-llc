llc.txt: Documentation for the Linux IEEE 802.2 LLC UI layer.
         Written by: Jay Schulist <jschlst@samba.org>

Logical Link Control (LLC) is a sublayer of the IEEE 802.2 LAN Protocol Suite.
LLC is the top sub-layer in the data link layer and is the common access
method to the different medium access techonologies such as Tokenring,
Ethernet and FDDI.

Linux-LLC provides two access facilities. Kernel level access and
User space socket access. This document contains information only on the
User space component of the Linux-LLC stack. Please use the 8022llc kernel
source files for documentation on Kernel level access.

LLC provides four (4) classes of communications. The current Linux-LLC
implementation supports Class One and Class Two LLC, support for Class
Three and Four is not implemented. Definition of the Classes follows:

Class One
 - Data-link Connectionless mode (Unacknowledged data transfer).
Class Two
 - Data-link Connection oriented and Data-link Connectionless mode.
Class Three
 - Acknowledged Connectionless mode and Data-link Connectionless mode.
Class Four
 - Support for Class One, Two and Three.

Linux Socket(2) type mappings to LLC Class Types.

LLC Class 1 socket types:
 - SOCK_DGRAM
LLC Class 2 socket types:
 - SOCK_STREAM
LLC Class 3 socket types:
 - SOCK_STREAM
 - SOCK_RDM

The following data structure is required for all connectionless and
some connection oriented socket calls to the LLC layer. All Linux-LLC
socket based applications must include the following header(s):

#include <linux/llc.h>

struct sockaddr_llc {
        sa_family_t     sllc_family;         
        sa_family_t     sllc_arphrd;            
        unsigned char   sllc_test;
        unsigned char   sllc_xid;
        unsigned char   sllc_ua;
        unsigned char   sllc_dsap;
        unsigned char   sllc_ssap;
        unsigned char   sllc_dmac[IFHWADDRLEN];
        unsigned char   sllc_smac[IFHWADDRLEN];
};

The description of each field follows:
sllc_family:	Always set to PF_LLC.
sllc_arphrd:	Set to the arp protocol type of the device which is assigned
		the specified smac in the field sllc_smac.
sllc_test:	Set to 1 when user is requesting transmission of an 
		LLC test command.
sllc_xid:	Set to 1 when user is requesting transmission of an
		XID command.
sllc_ua:	For connection oriented sockets only (SOCK_STREAM). Allows
		the connected socket to send unacknowledged data when set to 1.
sllc_dsap:	The destination SAP to communication with.
sllc_ssap:	The local or source SAP.
sllc_dmac:	The MAC address of the remote computer to communicate with.
sllc_smac:	The local or source MAC to transmit the data from.
