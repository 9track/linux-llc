** llc core **
- test frames over ~70 bytes will cause an skb_put oops. (need dynamic
  allocation of test response frames).
- client network layer needs to be able to tx test and xid rsp.
- client network layer needs to be able to rx test and xid cmd.

** pf_llc **
- llc2 recvmsg will lose data if whole frame is not read.
- allow multiple outbound same connections, parse on linkno. 
  llc2 in non-listen state, allocate new linkno - allow bind.

** lar **
- finish larhosts.xml to allow static lar host name resolution.
- wildcard support.
- check cached entries before network searches.
- updated cached entry when newer information arrives.
- enhance advertise/solicit packet support.

** dlsw **
- sock_raw, etc, for llc listener.
- rest of ssp commands/actions.
- process listener events.
- process partner ssp events.

** code en general **
- check for memory leaks.
- handle all errors.
