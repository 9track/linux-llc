.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm llcping
uses the
.Tn LLC 
protocol's mandatory
.Tn TEST COMMAND
to elicit a
.Tn LLC TEST RESPONSE
from a host or gateway.
.Tn LLC TEST COMMANDS
(``llcpings'') have an MAC and
.Tn LLC
header,
followed by a
.Dq struct timeval
and then an arbitrary number of ``pad'' bytes used to fill out the
packet.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h
Useless help information.
.It Fl x
Hexdump each outgoing and incomming llcping packet.
.It Fl b
Bit-swap the destination MAC address.
.It Fl c Ar count
Stop after sending (and receiving)
.Ar count
.Tn TEST
packets.
.It Fl f
Flood ping.
Outputs packets as fast as they come back or one hundred times per second,
whichever is more.
For every
.Tn TEST COMMAND
sent a period ``.'' is printed, while for ever
.Tn TEST RESPONSE
received a backspace is printed.
This provides a rapid display of how many packets are being dropped.
Only the super-user may use this option.
.Bf -emphasis
This can be very hard on a network and should be used with caution.
.Ef
.It Fl i Ar wait
Wait
.Ar wait
seconds
.Em between sending each packet .
The default is to wait for one second between each packet.
This option is incompatible with the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl t Ar 1|2
If
.Ar 1|2
is specified,
.Nm llcping
sends ``ping'' packets over an LLC1 or LLC2 connection. In order to
send a llc ping over LLC1 or LLC2 a LLC echo server must be configured
and running on the Destination MAC. AFAIK the linux-llc llcpingd is the
only echo server of this type. If
.Nm -t 1|2
is
.Nm *not*
specified llcping defaults to sending LLC TEST frames.
.It Fl s Ar ssap
Use
.Nm ssap
as the LLC connection's source SAP. If no ssap is specified or a ssap of 0x00
is specified the linux-llc stack will dynamicly allocate a ssap for this
connection.
.It Fl d Ar dsap
Use
.Nm dsap
as the LLC connection's destination SAP. If no dsap is specified then the default
is 0x00 or NULL DSAP. The remote LLC station will only respond to llc TEST frames
using a NULL DSAP.
.It Fl p Ar pattern
You may specify up to 16 ``pad'' bytes to fill out the packet you send.
This is useful for diagnosing data-dependent problems in a network.
For example,
.Dq Li \-p ff
will cause the sent packet to be filled with all
ones.
.It Fl q
Quiet output.
Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at startup time and
when finished.
.It Fl l Ar len
Specifies the number of data bytes to be sent.  
The default is 61, which translates into 64
.Tn LLC TEST COMMAND 
data bytes when combined
with the 3 bytes of
.Tn LLC
header data.
.It Fl v
Displays the current maintainer and version of 
.Nm llcping .
.El
.Pp
When using
.Nm llcping
for fault isolation, it should first be run on the local host, to verify
that the local network interface is up and running.
Round-trip times and packet loss statistics are computed.
If duplicate packets are received, they are not included in the packet
loss calculation, although the round trip time of these packets is used
in calculating the minimum/average/maximum round-trip time numbers.
When the specified number of packets have been sent (and received) or
if the program is terminated with a
.Dv SIGINT ,
a brief summary is displayed.
.Pp
If 
.Nm llcping
does not receive any reply packets at all it will exit with code 1.
On error it exits with code 2. Otherwise it exits with code 0. This
makes it possible to use the exit code to see if a host is alive or
not.
.Pp
This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and
management.
Because of the load it can impose on the network, it is unwise to use
.Nm llcping
during normal operations or from automated scripts.
.Sh DUPLICATE AND DAMAGED PACKETS
.Nm llcping
will report duplicate and damaged packets.
Duplicate packets should never occur, and seem to be caused by
inappropriate link-level retransmissions.
Duplicates may occur in many situations and are rarely (if ever) a
good sign, although the presence of low levels of duplicates may not
always be cause for alarm.
.Pp
Damaged packets are obviously serious cause for alarm and often
indicate broken hardware somewhere in the
.Nm llcping
packet's path (in the network or in the hosts).
.Sh TRYING DIFFERENT DATA PATTERNS
The (inter)network layer should never treat packets differently depending
on the data contained in the data portion.
Unfortunately, data-dependent problems have been known to sneak into
networks and remain undetected for long periods of time.
In many cases the particular pattern that will have problems is something
that doesn't have sufficient ``transitions'', such as all ones or all
zeros, or a pattern right at the edge, such as almost all zeros.
It isn't necessarily enough to specify a data pattern of all zeros (for
example) on the command line because the pattern that is of interest is
at the data link level, and the relationship between what you type and
what the controllers transmit can be complicated.
.Pp
This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will probably
have to do a lot of testing to find it.
If you are lucky, you may manage to find a file that either can't be sent
across your network or that takes much longer to transfer than other
similar length files.
You can then examine this file for repeated patterns that you can test
using the
.Fl p
option of
.Nm llcping .
.Sh BUGS
Prior to Linux kernel version 2.5.x LLC TEST commands were not honored
in Linux, hosts prior to kernel 2.5.x need to have a patched LLC layer.
.Pp
Flood pinging is not recommended in general, and flood pinging the
broadcast address should only be done under very controlled conditions.
