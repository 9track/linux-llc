.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm dlswd
uses the Data link switching protocol specified in RFCs 1434, 1795 and 2166. Data link
switching (DLSw) provides a means of transporting IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA)
and network basic input/output systems (NetBIOS) traffic over an IP network.

DLSw serves as an alternative to source-route bridging (SRB), a protocol for transporting
SNA and NetBIOS traffic in a Token Ring environment that was widely deployed prior to the
introduction of DLSw. In general DLSw addresses some of the shortcomings of SRB for certain
communication requirements - particularly in WAN implementations.

The Switch-to-Switch Protocol (SSP) is the protocol maintained between two DLSw nodes or routers.

The termination of SNA data link contorl (DLC) connections helps to reduce the likelihood of
link-layer timeouts across WANs.

The local mapping of DLC connections to a DLSw cicuit.

The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h
Useless help information.
.It Fl v
Displays the current maintainer and version of
.Nm dlswd .
.It Fl d Ar level
Set the debug output level for
.Nm dlswd .
If no debug level is specified the
.Nm dlswd
program will turn into a daemon process. The level of 1 - 10 is supported.
Level 5 will display information for each packet recevied and transmitted.
Level 10 includes all the display of level 5.
.It Fl f Ar config
Specify the location of the
.Nm dlswd
XML configuration file to use.
.Nm dlswd
will not function unless a valid configuration file is present in /etc/dlswd.xml or
the specified location using this option.
